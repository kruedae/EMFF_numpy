# EMFF_numpy
## Warning: The comments of this code are in spanish and are a disaster (I'll improve them soon)
This is an 'experimental' code for explore the numpy and scipy solvers for differential equations. 
The equations correspond to EMFF satellites described in Ashun text (document in bibliography) in many references systems
